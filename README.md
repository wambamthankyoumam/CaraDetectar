# CaraDetectar

The goal is to detect a face, then rotated, translated, cropped and scale so face identification
can be applied. 

ONLY WORKS IF BOTH EYEs are detected within a face!! 
This only works about fraction of the time...... But when it does!....

identifies the face, locates the two eyes, levels out the eyes and crops. 
this is for only setting up a face data base, face by face.
